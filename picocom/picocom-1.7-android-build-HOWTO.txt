Cross-build through the Android NDK
-----------------------------------

Set the needed environment variables as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

You can find the source code at http://code.google.com/p/picocom/
tar xf picocom-1.7.tar.gz ; cd picocom-1.7
Apply picocom-1.7-android.patch through the "patch -p1 < ..." command.
make -e
$STRIP picocom
MANWIDTH=70 man ./picocom.8 > picocom.8.txt

On the target system:
- Put the picocom executable and picocom.8.txt where it is convenient to you.
  (Remember to chmod the executable.)
- Create the UUCP_LOCK_DIR according to picocom-1.7-android.patch


Native build through a native GCC for Android
---------------------------------------------

Picocom can also be easily compiled through a native GCC for Android:
see https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends .
Apply picocom-1.7-android.patch, set CC=gcc, run make, strip the resulting
executable file.
