Set the needed environment variables as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

On the build system, remove directory trees /foobar and /system,
if they are present due to previous builds.

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/diffutils/diffutils-3.3.tar.xz
tar xf diffutils-3.3.tar.xz ; cd diffutils-3.3

Depending on the version of NDK, you may need to apply the hunks
in diffutils-3.2-android.patch, in particular the one involving localeconv().
It seems that no patch is needed if NDK r9 is used.

./configure \
 --host=arm-linux \
 --prefix=/foobar \
 --bindir=/system/xbin \
 --libdir=/system/lib \
 --mandir=/foobar/man
# Do *not* "make -e"
make
make install
$STRIP /system/xbin/*
tar cvf diffutils-3.3-arm.tar /system/xbin
( Expected output:
  # tar cvf diffutils-3.3-arm.tar /system/xbin
  tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
  /system/xbin/
  /system/xbin/diff3
  /system/xbin/sdiff
  /system/xbin/diff
  /system/xbin/cmp
)

On the build system, remove directory trees /foobar and /system.

Care is needed to install on the target system, as, very likely, at least
a simpler version of the diff utility is preinstalled.
AFAIK, usually, to avoid collisions, you only need to:
- rename a symbolic link to /system/bin/toolbox
  mv /system/bin/cmp /system/bin/cmp.toolbox
- rename two symbolic links to /system/xbin/busybox
  mv /system/xbin/cmp /system/xbin/cmp.busybox
  mv /system/xbin/diff /system/xbin/diff.busybox
Anyway, please remember that there are so many different Android
versions/devices, hence I just can't know all possible setups: please,
carefully investigate your system before installing this package; if you get
in troubles, you are on your own, I do not take any responsibility for this.

To install, perform the following steps on the target device:
- temporarily remount /system as read/write:
  mount -o remount,rw /system
- if you installed a previous version, then carefully remove it, as Android
  will not overwrite old files with new ones
- extract the package in the root directory ("/"): as an example,
  put it in the /sdcard dir of the target system, then
  cd /
  tar xvf /sdcard/diffutils-3.3-arm.tar
- remount /system as read-only:
  mount -o remount,ro /system
