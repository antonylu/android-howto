This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

mount -o remount,rw /

Use /data/local/bin/sh -> /data/local/bin/mksh, whose build is documented
in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
( If you use /system/bin/sh -> /system/bin/mksh instead, you may have
  to do something like
  ln -s /sdcard/tmp /sqlite_stmt_journals
)
To let /bin/sh and /tmp be available and avoid patching some scripts:
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
ln -s /data/local/bin /bin ; ln -s /sdcard/tmp /tmp

mount -o remount,ro /

The /bin and /tmp symbolic links will not be persistent: they will not survive
the reboot.

Put the diffutils-3.3.tar.xz sources in your build directory, whereas
diffutils-3.2-android.patch should not be needed.
Go to your build directory.
Please note that the following issue may occur when you untar sources:
http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-September/073298.html
(but it can be easily solved by un-tar-ing and tar-ing again on a GNU/Linux
box ;-) )
tar xf diffutils-3.3.tar.xz ; cd diffutils-3.3

./configure \
 --prefix=/data/local \
 --bindir=/data/local/bin \
 --libdir=/data/local/lib \
 --mandir=/data/local/share/man
make ; make install
( cd /data/local/bin ; strip cmp diff diff3 sdiff )
