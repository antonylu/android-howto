This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

config.h includes <arpa/tftp.h>, that is not available in Bionic.
The procedure described here employs the arpa/tftp.h taken from glibc.
I successfully used the /usr/include/arpa/tftp.h available in
GNU/Linux Ubuntu (the 14.04 x86_64 and the 12.04 x86 versions),
provided by the libc6-dev package.
Awful, but simple, and it works.

mount -o remount,rw /

Use /data/local/bin/sh -> /data/local/bin/mksh, whose build is documented
in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
( If you use /system/bin/sh -> /system/bin/mksh instead, you may have
  to do something like
  ln -s /sdcard/tmp /sqlite_stmt_journals
)
To let /bin/sh and /tmp be available and avoid patching some scripts:
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
ln -s /data/local/bin /bin ; ln -s /sdcard/tmp /tmp

mount -o remount,ro /

The /bin and /tmp symbolic links will not be persistent: they will not survive
the reboot.

Put in your build directory the tftp-hpa-5.2.tar.gz sources,
tftp-hpa-5.2-android-native_build.patch, and the tftp.h taken from glibc.
Go to your build directory.

tar xf tftp-hpa-5.2.tar.gz ; cd tftp-hpa-5.2
cp ../tftp.h .
patch -p1 < ../tftp-hpa-5.2-android-native_build.patch
./configure
# It does the same as
# ./configure \
#   --with-ipv6 --without-tcpwrappers --without-readline --without-remap
make
strip tftp/tftp tftpd/tftpd

Rooted Android systems may provide busybox with tftp and tftpd applets enabled:
/system/xbin/tftp and /system/xbin/tftpd may be available as symbolic links
to /system/xbin/busybox.
Hence, to avoid troubles, I suggest to rename, adding the -hpa suffix:
( cd tftp ; mv tftp tftp-hpa ; mv tftp.1 tftp-hpa.1 )
( cd tftpd ; mv tftpd tftpd-hpa ; mv tftpd.8 tftpd-hpa.8 )

Put executables (tftp/tftp-hpa and tftpd/tftpd-hpa)
and man pages (tftp/tftp-hpa.1 and tftpd/tftpd-hpa.8)
where it is convenient to you.
