HOWTO setup an Ethernet wired connection on Android using a USB-LAN adapter
***************************************************************************

----------
Disclaimer
----------

This HOWTO assumes usage of root privileges, i.e. that your device is rooted.
It is also assumed that you are able to use a root shell on a Terminal Emulator
on Android: its usage is implicitly assumed (and is never explicitly cited).
Rooting your Android device might void your warranty, damage it,
kill your cat, burn your house, and cause many other dreadful things.
I do not take any responsibility, you are completely on your own.
If you don't know what "rooting Android" means, this HOWTO is not suited
for you.

-------------------
Scope of this HOWTO
-------------------

In some situations, you may want to use a wired Ethernet connection on your
tablet/smartphone: as an example,
- when it is the only networking option
- when it is faster/more reliable than the available wireless options
- when you want to directly connect to another device
With reference to the last point: as an example, you may want to use
a mobile device to backup a Cisco router/switch
(read Android-USB-Serial-Connection-HOWTO.txt as an example).
This document assumes you want to use a USB-LAN adapter for this purpose.

--------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: a USB port with USB OTG (On The Go) support
--------------------------------------------------------

To use the USB-LAN adapter on your tablet/smartphone, you need hardware
and software support of USB OTG.
Refer to Android-USB-Serial-Connection-HOWTO.txt for this topic.

--------------------------------------------------
Build a kernel module to drive the USB-LAN adapter
--------------------------------------------------

If you already use the adapter on GNU/Linux, very likely you can use is
on Android, too, as Android is based on the Linux kernel.
Check which kernel module drives your adapter on GNU/Linux, then
refer to Android-Build-Kernel-Modules-HOWTO.txt for compilation
of the same kernel module for Android.

The adapter I tested relies on the mcs7830.ko kernel module,
hence in the .config I set
CONFIG_USB_NET_MCS7830=m
(dependent on CONFIG_USB_USBNET).

-------------------------------------------------------------
Connect the adapter, load the module, configure IP addressing
-------------------------------------------------------------

Load the module through either insmod or modprobe, as explained in
Android-Build-Kernel-Modules-HOWTO.txt

If the module loads fine, plug the USB OTG cable and the USB-LAN adapter,
as explained in Android-USB-Serial-Connection-HOWTO.txt
and then the USB-serial adapter.
If everything goes well, the output of the "dmesg" command should report
that a new USB device has been added and that /dev/eth0 has been created,
and this can be confirmed by the command
ls -l /dev/eth0

Connect the adapter to another Ethernet device.
Please note that, very likely, the adapter does not support MDIX; hence,
if also the other device does support MDIX (as an example, an old Cisco
router/switch), you can not use either a straight-through or a crossover cable
indifferently, you just need the right cable for your case: very likely,
a straight-through cable to connect to a switch, a crossover cable to connect
to a router.

Configure IP addressing: as an example,
ip -4 addr add 10.255.255.7/24 dev eth0
ip -4 addr show

Test connectivity to a neighbor using the ping command.
