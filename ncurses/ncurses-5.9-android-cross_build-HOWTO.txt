Set the environment variables needed to use Android NDK as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.9.tar.gz
tar xf ncurses-5.9.tar.gz ; cd ncurses-5.9

Apply ncurses-5.9-android.patch through the "patch -p1 < ..." command.

If you want the user's terminfo database to be in /sdcard/[username]/.terminfo
then also apply ncurses-5.9-android-sdcardhome.patch through "patch -p1 < ...".

./configure --host=arm-linux \
 --prefix=/foobar \
 --bindir=/system/xbin \
 --datadir=/system/usr/share \
 --libdir=/system/lib \
 --with-shared \
 --without-cxx \
 --without-cxx-binding
make
# "make -e" is OK, too
make install
$STRIP /system/xbin/*
$STRIP --strip-unneeded /system/lib/*.so*

Care is needed to install on the target system, as there may be
a preinstalled version of the library, used by other programs
than the one(s) you are building ncurses for.
To the best of my knowledge, usually:
- filenames of preinstalled libraries do not include the version number,
  e.g. /system/lib/libncurses.so, neither /system/lib/libncurses.so.5,
  nor /system/lib/libncurses.so.5.9
- symbolic links are not used by preinstalled libraries
- programs built according to instructions in this repository will link
  filenames including the version number, e.g. VIM will link
  libncurses.so.5, not libncurses.so
Hence, a simple solution consists of installing the library without
the symbolic links whose filenames do not include any version number,
e.g. installing /system/lib/libncurses.so.5 and /system/lib/libncurses.so.5.9
but *not* /system/lib/libncurses.so
Furthermore, very likely, on the target system, you will not need binary
executables of ncurses (see /system/xbin on the build system).
Hence, I suggest to prepare this way the package to be installed
on the target system:
tar cf ncurses-5.9-arm.tar \
  /system/usr/share \
  /system/lib/libform.so.5 \
  /system/lib/libform.so.5.9 \
  /system/lib/libmenu.so.5 \
  /system/lib/libmenu.so.5.9 \
  /system/lib/libncurses.so.5 \
  /system/lib/libncurses.so.5.9 \
  /system/lib/libpanel.so.5 \
  /system/lib/libpanel.so.5.9
Anyway, please remember that there are so many different Android
versions/devices, hence I just can't know all possible setups: please,
carefully investigate your system before installing the library; if you get
in troubles, you are on your own, I do not take any responsibility for this.

To install, perform the following steps on the target device:
- temporarily remount /system as read/write:
  mount -o remount,rw /system
- if you installed a previous version, then carefully remove it, as Android
  will not overwrite old files with new ones
- extract the package in the root directory ("/"): as an example,
  put it in the /sdcard dir of the target system, then
  cd /
  tar xvf /sdcard/ncurses-5.9-arm.tar
- remount /system as read-only:
  mount -o remount,ro /system

Suggestion: after preparation of the package for the target system,
you may want to remove /foobar and /system from the build system;
however, I suggest to keep the directory where you cross-compiled
the library: in the future, you may want to cross-compile a program
requiring ncurses, without building ncurses again, and you will only need
to "make install" ncurses again.
