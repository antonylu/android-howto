This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

The original source code can be found at
https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm =>
https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh-R49.tgz
http://pub.allbsd.org/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh-R49.tgz

Put mksh-R49.tgz and mksh-R49-android.patch in your build directory.

tar xf mksh-R49.tgz ; mv mksh mksh-R49 ; cd mksh-R49
export LDFLAGS=-static
patch -p1 < ../mksh-R49-android.patch
sh Build.sh
strip mksh
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
mkdir -p /data/local/bin
mkdir -p /data/local/etc
chown root.root /data/local/bin /data/local/etc
chmod 755 /data/local/bin /data/local/etc
cp mksh /data/local/bin
( cd /data/local/bin ; ln -sf mksh sh )
touch /data/local/etc/mkshrc
chown root.root /data/local/bin/mksh
chmod 755 /data/local/bin/mksh
chmod 644 /data/local/etc/mkshrc

I suggest to add the following statements to /data/local/etc/mkshrc:

#if (( USER_ID )); then HOME=/sdcard/$USER; else HOME=/data/local/root; fi
if (( USER_ID )); then HOME=/sdcard; else HOME=/data; fi
export HOME
HISTFILE=$HOME/.mksh_history
HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTFILE HISTSIZE
alias su='su -c /data/local/bin/mksh'
[[ -s $HOME/.mkshrc ]] && . $HOME/.mkshrc
#cd $HOME
export PWD

About setting HOME
------------------
It may happen that a non-root user has a non completely accessible directory
as its HOME.
As an example, "/" is not writable (even though the root user can temporarily
remount it as rw) and /data is not writable and not listable for non-root users.
To allow normal operation of programs that expect they can write in HOME,
I prefer to be sure that HOME is set to (a subdir of) /sdcard for non-root users
and to (a subdir of) /data for the root.
As an example, on the Nexus 7 GSM 2012 with Cyanogenmod 10.1.3, HOME
is set by default to "/data" if I access through "adb shell", i.e.
with the "shell" user (uid=2000(shell)), and IMHO this is not comfortable.
By the way, setting HOME to /sdcard for all non-root users may be useful
because, with the particular management of users implemented by Android,
different identities are assumed, depending on which program you run
to access the shell.
As an example, different users are associated to the shell when it runs from:
- Android Terminal Emulator
- JS Terminal
- ADB shell
Even when I am not root, I prefer to access just the same history of shell
commands and the same settings from wherever I run the shell, hence
I set HOME to /sdcard for *all* non-root users.

About "export"ing PWD
---------------------
In some cases, errors may occur when launching bash if all the following
conditions hold true:
- you access the device through "adb shell" (==> uid=2000(shell) in my case)
- mksh is the shell provided for such access
- you are in a particular directory
  (/sdcard, as an example, but it occurs for other directories, too)
- PWD has not been "export"ed by mksh
- you launch a statically linked bash from mksh
This is an example of errors occurring for bash in such a case:
------------------------------
shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Unknown error: 0
sh_makepath: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
------------------------------
It seems that explicitly "export"ing PWD in mksh fixes this rare and weird
problem (at least, it works for me).
