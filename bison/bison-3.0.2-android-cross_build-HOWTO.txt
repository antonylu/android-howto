Set the environment variables needed to use Android NDK as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

The build requires that perl, texinfo, and help2man are installed
on the build system: as an example, on GNU/Linux Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64,
apt-get install perl texinfo help2man

Put the bison-3.0.2.tar.xz sources and bison-3.0.2-android-cross_build.patch
in your build directory.

NOTE: the original build process (without any patch) assumes that
the src/bison executable is built and then used to build documentation.
If you cross-compile, the resulting src/bison can be run on the target
platform, but it can not be run on the build platform.
This is the reason why the patch replaces src/bison with bison; hence,
to cross-compile, you need to have bison installed on the build platform.
As an alternative, you can disable the build of documentation, using
the patch available for the native build.

Go to your build directory.
tar xf bison-3.0.2.tar.xz ; cd bison-3.0.2
patch -p1 < ../bison-3.0.2-android-cross_build.patch

A dirty trick to let "configure" find m4 where it can be found on the
target device (the full path of m4 will be hardcoded in the bison executable):
rm -rf /system
mkdir -p /system/xbin
cp -a /usr/bin/m4 /system/xbin/m4
export PATH=/system/xbin:$PATH

./configure \
 --host=arm-linux \
 --prefix=/system \
 --bindir=/system/xbin \
 --libdir=/system/lib \
 --datarootdir=/system/usr/share \
 --mandir=/system/usr/share/man \
 --disable-rpath \
 --disable-nls

make ; make install
$STRIP /system/xbin/bison
rm /system/xbin/m4

tar cf bison-3.0.2-arm.tar /system

To install, perform the following steps on the target device:
- temporarily remount /system as read/write:
  mount -o remount,rw /system
- if you installed a previous version, then carefully remove it, as Android
  will not overwrite old files with new ones
- extract the package in the root directory ("/"): as an example,
  put it in the /sdcard dir of the target system, then
  cd /
  tar xvf /sdcard/bison-3.0.2-arm.tar
- remount /system as read-only:
  mount -o remount,ro /system
