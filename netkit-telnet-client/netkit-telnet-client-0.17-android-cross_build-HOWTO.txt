Set the needed environment variables as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

NOTE: Only the telnet client is build, the telnet daemon is *not*.

The ncurses library is needed, hence, according to the corresponding
documentation in this repository:
- on the build system, build ncurses, following instructions at least
  until the "make install" step
- on the target system, install the ncurses package

To match directories where ncurses-5.9 has been "cross-installed"
and to add some other needed options:
export LIBS=-lgnustl_static
export LDFLAGS="-L/system/lib -L$NDK_BASE/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/$GCC_VERSION/libs/armeabi"
export CXXFLAGS="-I/foobar/include -I$NDK_BASE/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/$GCC_VERSION/include"

Unpack and patch the source code just as explained in the companion HOWTO
for the native build.

cd telnet
make
$STRIP telnet

Put the executable on the target device, in the directory you prefer,
with the filename you prefer, paying attention to avoid overwriting other
programs with the same filename (as an example, a busybox telnet applet may be
already installed); remember to appropriately chown, chgrp, and chmod it.
