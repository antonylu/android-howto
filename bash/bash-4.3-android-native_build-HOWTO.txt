This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

Building against the ncurses library makes bash more comfortable.
Hence, build and install ncurses following the corresponding documentation
available in this repository.

mount -o remount,rw /

Use /data/local/bin/sh -> /data/local/bin/mksh, whose build is documented
in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
( If you use /system/bin/sh -> /system/bin/mksh instead, you may have
  to do something like
  ln -s /sdcard/tmp /sqlite_stmt_journals
)
To let /bin/sh and /tmp be available and avoid patching some scripts:
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
ln -s /data/local/bin /bin ; ln -s /sdcard/tmp /tmp

mount -o remount,ro /

The /bin and /tmp symbolic links will not be persistent: they will not survive
the reboot.

Put the bash-4.3.tar.gz sources and all patches in your build directory.
Go to your build directory.

tar xf bash-4.3.tar.gz ; cd bash-4.3
Apply the following patches through the "patch -p1 < ..." command:
bash-4.3-android-01.patch
bash-4.3-android-02.patch
bash-4.3-android-03-getcwd.patch
bash-4.3-android-07-endpwent_warning_and_default_bin_sh.patch
bash-4.3-android-08-bashbug_bang.patch
bash-4.3-android-native_build-01.patch
bash-4.3-android-native_build-05-default_paths.patch
bash-4.3-android-native_build-06-change_SYS_PROFILE.patch

For /data/local/etc/bash.bashrc and /data/local/etc/bash.bash_logout,
you can refer to
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_bash/tree/cm-10.2/etc
as a starting point.
I suggest to add the following statements to /data/local/etc/bash.bashrc:

#if [[ ${EUID} == 0 ]]; then HOME=/data/local/root; else HOME=/sdcard/$USER; fi
if [[ ${EUID} == 0 ]]; then HOME=/data; else HOME=/sdcard; fi
export HOME
alias su='su -c /data/local/bin/bash'
#cd $HOME

To know the reasons why I suggest this setting of HOME, you can refer to
the documentation in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
