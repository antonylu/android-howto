This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

mount -o remount,rw /

Use /data/local/bin/sh -> /data/local/bin/mksh, whose build is documented
in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
( If you use /system/bin/sh -> /system/bin/mksh instead, you may have
  to do something like
  ln -s /sdcard/tmp /sqlite_stmt_journals
)
To let /bin/sh and /tmp be available and avoid patching some scripts:
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
ln -s /data/local/bin /bin ; ln -s /sdcard/tmp /tmp

mount -o remount,ro /

The /bin and /tmp symbolic links will not be persistent: they will not survive
the reboot.

Put the m4-1.4.17.tar.xz sources in your build directory.
No patches should be needed.
Go to your build directory.
tar xf m4-1.4.17.tar.xz ; cd m4-1.4.17
