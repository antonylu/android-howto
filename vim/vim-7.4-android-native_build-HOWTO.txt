This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

The ncurses library is needed.
Hence, build and install ncurses following the corresponding documentation
available in this repository.

Furthermore, "vimdiff" requires diffutils (see detailed notes at the end
of this document).
Hence, build and install diffutils following the corresponding documentation
available in this repository.

mount -o remount,rw /

Use /data/local/bin/sh -> /data/local/bin/mksh, whose build is documented
in https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/mksh
( If you use /system/bin/sh -> /system/bin/mksh instead, you may have
  to do something like
  ln -s /sdcard/tmp /sqlite_stmt_journals
)
To let /bin/sh and /tmp be available and avoid patching some scripts:
mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp
ln -s /data/local/bin /bin ; ln -s /sdcard/tmp /tmp

mount -o remount,ro /

The /bin and /tmp symbolic links will not be persistent: they will not survive
the reboot.

Put the vim-7.4.tar.bz2 sources and vim-7.4-android-native_build.patch
in your build directory.
tar xf vim-7.4.tar.bz2 ; cd vim74
patch -p1 < ../vim-7.4-android-native_build.patch

./configure \
 --with-tlib=ncurses \
 --prefix=/data/local \
 --bindir=/data/local/bin \
 --datarootdir=/data/local/share \
 --mandir=/data/local/share/man

make
make install
( cd /data/local/bin ; strip vim xxd )

mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp

Create /data/local/share/vim/vimrc according to your needs/preferences;
you may want to create it as an empty file:
touch /data/local/share/vim/vimrc
(I'm providing my favourite vimrc for Android: vimrc-android.)
chown root.root /data/local/share/vim/vimrc
chmod 644 /data/local/share/vim/vimrc

------------------------------
Why vimdiff requires diffutils
------------------------------
:help vimdiff
==> [...] This only works when a standard "diff" command is available. [...]
man busybox
==> "diff" section ==> This implementation supports unified diffs only.
man diff
==> To realize that the default ("standard") diff and a unified diff
     are not the same.
Conclusion: for vimdiff to be useful, replace the busybox diff
with diff from diffutils.
